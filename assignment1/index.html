        <!--Use a div container element so it arranges the elements in blocks, if used span, the answer would be next to the question instead of below-->

        <div>
            <h4>1. <u>Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</u></h4>
            <p>I clicked the url, I dragged my mouse around which caused a ripple effect on the page. I interacted with the sliders by sliding it up and down to change the ripple effect. Then I clicked the menu on the top to a different experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>2. <u>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</u></h4>
            <p>The first thing I paid attention to when using this website is a ripple effect that surrounded the mouse.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>3. <u>What did you spend the most time engaging with?</u></h4>
            <p>I spent the most time dragging my mouse around a lot to cause the ripple effect .</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>4. <u>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</u></h4>
            <p>The most common action was me dragging my mouse around the webpage to cause the ripple effect.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>5. <u>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</u></h4>
            <p>I think the intended primary goal of this website was to provide relaxation.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>6. <u>How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</u></h4>
            <p>I think the experience communicated its primary goal pretty well as I feel relaxed after using the website.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>7. <u>What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</u></h4>
            <p>I think the intended length of the action of dragging my mouse around to cause a ripple effect is pretty long, around 5 mins. This is because the action is very visually stimulating as the action causes motion on the website which catches the eye. I can also slide the scale up and down to change the effect of the ripple</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>8. <u>What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</u></h4>
            <p>I think the experience represents the metaphor of flowing and ripples in the water when a person or any thing touches it.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>9. <u>What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</u></h4>
            <p>I think this suggests that when engaging with the website, I should feel relaxed and at peace. This is because relaxation is often associated with the movement and the flow of water.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>10. <u>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</u></h4>
            <p>The most frustrating element of the interaction would be iinteracting and controlling the scale on the side to customise the ripple effect. I find this frustrating because it was hard to gauge how much to scale up or down to get the intended ripple effect I wanted.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>11. <u>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</u></h4>
            <p>The most satisfying element of the interaction be the corresponding ripples that it produces when i move my mouse, I find this satisfying because the ripples are produced really smoothly without any glitches or cuts.</p>
        </div>
